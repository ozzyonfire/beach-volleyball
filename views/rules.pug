			p #[strong Note] It is very important to show up to your games on time to ensure we get through all the games that night.
		h2 Fees
		p Each player pays a fee of $30.00. This money goes towards improving the court (eg. adding sand, better lighting, volleyballs and scoreboard), prizes, dinner for the last game, and administrative fees to the Campbellâ€™s. We may even expand the facilities and open up another court due to a high demand of players.
